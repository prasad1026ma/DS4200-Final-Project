        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Stock market crashes are instances in the market with great economic ramifications, impacting not only investors, but the overall economy. A few of the most influential firms in the tech industry, the MAANG companies, (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google), make up a notable portion of the S&P 500, making their stock performance pertinent to market stability. During the 2008 financial crisis, the stock market saw unprecedented volatility, and tech companies were not immune to these shocks. Since these companies occupy a dominant position in the market, understanding the trends of their stock prices can help us identify what triggers the market to crash, protecting investments, minimizing risk, and preventing economic crises. This project intends to leverage stock data from these tech giants to investigate the causes of market crashes. </p>
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Our data was collected from a kaggle source (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumendraprasad/stock?select=Amazon.csv) that includes stock information from the MAANG companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nexflix, and Google). These companies are considered major tech companies and have high stakes in the stock market, comprising 15% of the S&P 500.</p>
        <p>In Kaggle, this data was separated into different csv files by company, each including the following attributes: open, high, low, close, adjusted close, volume, and date. The open value is the company's stock price at the time the market opens. The close, showing the market price at the time of the market closing. The high and low shows the company's highest and lowest stock price in the day. The adjusted close is the closing price after adjustments for splits and dividend distributions. The volume is the number of shares traded over the day. </p>
        <p>Along with these categories, in the combined data set, we have supplemented this with a categorical variables indicating the gdp data, company data, and top three new articles posted on the stock market from that day. Once combined on the common category of date, we are left with 35 columns. There are 5839 rows in the finalized dataset, out of which we will be selecting only the years of the stock market crash (both pre and post analysis) to learn of fluctuations in the market.</p>
        <p>In addition to our main dataset, we have used other datasets to gather specific company and social information to gather a hoslistic point-of-view on the implications of the data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sentiment Data - The data showcases the top 20 headlines for every day, as released by financial related journals ie. the yahoo finance. The data was extracted from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lykin22/stock-headlines?select=Stock+Headlines.csv) and only the top 4 headlines per day were used for simplicity purposes. From this, a sentiment score for each of the headlines was calculated, using TextBlobs sentiment score feature. The four sentiment scores were then averaged, resulting in an average sentiment score per day.</li>
                <li>Trends Data - This data displays the top Google searches per year, organized by category, query, and query ranking within the category. The data was extracted from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/google-trends-dataset) and only #1 query from 2006-2013 for specific, revelant categories were used.</li>
                <li>GDP Data - The GDP data represents the quarterly real GDP values of the United States from 2006 to 2013. The dataset was extracted from FRED Economic Data (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) GDP growth rates were calculated as the percentage change between consecutive quarters, providing insight into economic trends during the period.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Data Preprocessing and Cleaning</h3>
        <p>We filtered our MAANG stock datasets to capture only the years from 2006 to 2013 inclusive, representing the pre and post time of the 2008 Stock Market Crash. We started by converting the Date column to datetime, then isolating only the dates from our desired range. We then stacked the individual company dataframes and added an additional column to indicate the company that the data is coming from. We handled missing or invalid values by dropping these rows entirely, rather than utilizing imputation which may risk skewing the distribution of the data.</p>

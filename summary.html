        <h3>Learnings from Visualizations</h3>
        <p> The data visualizations all show a common theme related to the stock market crash of 2008. In a more general sense, it gives economists a sense of possible social and economic effects of such a crash. Each graph explains different aspects of the market crash:</p>
            <li><strong>Line Graph:</strong> Demonstrates the varied resilience of the top tech companies to economic stressors</li>
            <li><strong>Area Graph:</strong> Suggests significant trading activity during the crash and recovery phases possibly due to investor panic and speculative opportunities. Apple's dominance in trading volumes reflects its strong market impact during this timeframe</li>
            <li><strong>Sentiment Graph:</strong> Fluctuations in the sentiment across companies indicate heightened public reaction through the news to both declines and recoveries, reflecting psychological impacts of the crash</li>
            <li><strong>Query Graph:</strong> Showcases that public interest in economic/technology increased as stock trends fluctuated. In general, they provide insights into consumer sentiment during economic uncertainty</li>
            <li><strong>Heatmap GraphL</strong> Exposes how strong relationships among stock performance metrics have a moderate link to GDP growth. This highlights that while the stock market crash impacted GDP, internal market dynamics perhaps played a significant role.</li>
        <p>The intricate relationship between macroeconomic indicators, public sentiment, and market behaviors before, during, and after the 2008 financial crash illustrate that economic downturns have many predictors, such as trading patterns, GDP shifts, and public interest reflected in search behaviors. These insights give economists, policymakers, and investors the tools to better predict and respond to future crises. If furture crises such as these were to occur, early warning systems could integrate sentiment analysis, trading volume spikes, and correlations with macroeconomic indicators to detect signs of market instability. Moreover, by understanding the social reactions to economic stress such as consumer and news reactions, we can learn how to guide communication strategies during downturns</p>

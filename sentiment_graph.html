        <h3>Scatter Plot showing Percentage Change in Stock Price vs Average Sentiment by Company</h3>
        <iframe src="sentiment_graph_altair.html" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe> 
        <p> The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the percentage change in stock price and average sentiment score derived from daily financial headlines for major MAANG companies.
             Using the top four headlines per day, sentiment scores were calculated and averaged to represent the overall market sentiment. Utilizing tooltip and selection features to hone in on more precise values, 
             the graph reveals a clear clustering around neutral sentiment and minimal price changes, reflecting the market's stability on most days. However, extreme positive or negative price changes show a wider spread 
             in sentiment, indicating that strong market movements often correlate with polarized news headlines. This analysis highlights the impact of financial news on stock performance, demonstrating that optimistic 
             headlines are typically associated with price gains, while negative sentiment aligns with price declines. The insights can aid in understanding investor behavior and predicting market responses to news events.

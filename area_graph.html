        <h3> Monthly Volume Distribution for Each MAANG Company</h3>
        <iframe src="area_graph_altair.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe> 
        <p>Here, we are looking at the monthly volume of shares per MAANG company from 2006 to 2013. From this interactive stacked area graph, we can clearly see the trends in monthly trading volume via selection of individual companies. 
            Changes in total volume are most obvious for Apple. Apple experienced highs in monthly trading volume around January 2007 and again in October 2008. This directly reflects the effects of stock market crash as it was a period 
            of increased market volatility, instability, and risk, during which investors ended up trading great volumes of shares. The volume generally decreases from 2009 and onward, reflecting the economic recovery period and investors' 
            decreased desire to trade in a more stable market, as well as the huge impact that the financial crisis had on the market in terms of overall trading volume. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google also follow this trend at a smaller scale.
            Netflix does not see growth in monthly shares volume until the 2010s, likely due to its popuarization during this period. From this, we gain further insights and understanding of market volatility's effect on various features of 
            stock trade, such as monthly volume here.

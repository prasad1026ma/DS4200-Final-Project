        <p>We firstly present an overview of daily price fluctuations in MAANG stock from 2006 to 2013. We can see that Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Google tend to follow generally similar trends in their stock pricing, while Netflix seems to operate separately.
            The year of 2008 demostrates decreasing stock prices for all 5 companies, most drastically displayed by Microsoft and Google whose stock prices plummeted the most. Netflix's price seemed to change the least in this time period.
            We can also see that into 2009 and onward, all companies were on the path to recovery via their increasing stock prices. Netflix's stock price has grown exponentially from 2010 to 2012, where it them experiences the largest drop of all the companies
            towards the end of 2011. This is due to an increase in subscription plan pricing, which caused Netflix to lose many customers. Despite this, Netflix's price at the end of 2013 is on par with Microsoft, which has most consistently had the highest stock 
            prices of all the MAANG companies. This visualization reflects the effect of economic events and corporate decisions on each comapany's stock price.

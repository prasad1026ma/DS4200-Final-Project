        <h3>YAnnual Trends in Search Query Categories and Their Similarity to Market Terms </h3>
        <iframe src="query_graph_altair.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe> 
        <p> This bar chart displays the top Google search queries by their category against the similarity score between words in each category and relevant stock market terms between 2006 to 2013.
            Most notably from this semantic similarity comparison, we can see that the category "It's the Economy" had a full similarity score in 2008. Similarly, 2011 and 2012 featured full similarity 
            scores for the cateogories "Economy" and "Stocks," respectively. These scores highlight the relevance of financial markets to US citizens during those periods and align with major financial 
            events such as the stock market crash of 2008, the U.S. debt ceiling crisis in 2011, and and the Eurozone debt crisis in 2012. Meanwhile, Google-specific categories, such as "Google News Searches", 
            indicate moderate alignment, underscoring Google's role in sharing financial information. Although the graph does not directly link these trends to Google's stock performance, it demonstrates 
            how shifts in public interest reflect broader economic conditions and the relevance of Google's platform in providing market-related insights.</p>

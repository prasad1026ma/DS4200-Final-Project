Visual Analysis of the 2008 Financial Crisis on MAANG Stock Trends
    We looked heavily into the effect of the 2008 Stock Market Crash on the MAANG companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) 
in the years surrounding the crisis. To display our analysis, we developed a webpage that showcases the visualizations we developed to 
guide our research and communicate our findings. Here, we include five visualizations that analyze stock pricing, public sentiment and 
web searches, and overall nation statistics during the 2006 to 2013 time period. These visualizations range from general to more specific,
 providing an insightful look into the market as a whole during this time. 

Average Daily Stock Price Per MAANG Company
    This visualization provides an overview of daily price fluctuations in MAANG stocks from 2006 to 2013. The marks in this graph are lines, 
each representing the stock price trend of a company over time. The channels include the x-axis position, which shows time, as well as y-axis
position, which shows average stock prices, allowing for quantitative comparisons.  We also utilize color to differentiate companies, with 
each line assigned a distinct color as indicated by the legend.  We chose to represent this data using a line graph because it is ideal for
displaying continuous data, such as stock prices, over time. The continuity of the lines highlights trends, patterns, and fluctuations, 
while the clear paths allow for comparisons across companies. Unlike bar charts or scatter plots, line graphs emphasize temporal progression
and make it easy to track changes for multiple entities simultaneously.
    From this graph, we can see that Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Google generally follow similar trends in their stock pricing, 
while Netflix’s stock price stands out with a distinct trajectory. The year 2008 demonstrates decreasing stock prices for all companies, 
with Microsoft and Google showing the steepest declines. Following this period, stock prices for all companies recovered post-2009, as 
reflected in their upward trends. Netflix, in particular, exhibited exponential growth between 2010 and 2012 but experienced the largest
drop among all companies toward the end of 2011. This decline can be attributed to an increase in subscription pricing, which caused 
Netflix to lose many customers. Despite this, by the end of 2013, Netflix's price aligned with Microsoft's, which had maintained the most
consistent high stock prices among the companies throughout the observed period.  
    This visualization highlights the impact of economic events like the 2008 financial crisis and corporate decisions, such as Netflix’s 
pricing strategy, on stock prices. By leveraging lines, positions, and colors, the line graph effectively communicates trends, fluctuations,
and relative performance among the MAANG companies over time.

Monthly Volume Distribution for Each MAANG Company
    This visualization examines the monthly trading volume of shares for each MAANG company from 2006 to 2013. The marks in this graph are 
stacked areas, with each area representing the trading volume of a single company. The channels used are x-axis position showing monthly
time intervals, y-axis position showing total volume of shares traded, color to differentiate companies, and size/area height to represent
the volume of shares, with larger areas indicating higher trading activity. A stacked area graph was chosen to represent this data because
it is well-suited to show cumulative data, such as total trading volume over time, while also allowing for the comparison of individual
company contributions. The stacking highlights the relative contributions of each company to the total volume and makes it easy to identify 
dominant players like Apple.
    Key insights from this graph include Apple's dominance in trading volume, particularly in January 2007 and October 2008, corresponding to
periods of increased market volatility. This reflects the effects of the 2008 financial crisis, during which investors engaged in high-volume
trading amid market instability and risk. Post-2009, the total volume generally decreases, indicating an economic recovery and reduced investor 
urgency. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google follow similar patterns on a smaller scale, while Netflix’s trading volume does not significantly grow 
until the 2010s, likely due to its rising popularity during that period.
    This visualization effectively communicates the impact of economic events like the financial crisis and the differences in trading activity 
across companies. The stacked areas provide both a cumulative view of total trading volume and insights into individual company contributions, 
enhancing our understanding of market behavior during this time.

Percentage Change in Stock Price vs Average Sentiment by Company
    This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between the percentage change in stock price and average sentiment score derived from daily 
financial headlines for major MAANG companies. Using the top four headlines per day, sentiment scores were calculated and averaged to 
represent overall market sentiment. The marks in these graphs are scatter points, with the top graph displaying the complete dataset and 
the bottom graph providing a filtered view based on user interactions. The channels used include the x-axis for percentage change in stock 
prices and the y-axis for average sentiment scores. Color differentiates companies, while interactivity allows users to filter data by 
selecting specific areas on the top graph, choosing companies via the legend, and selecting years using buttons. 
    Scatter plots were chosen to represent this data because they effectively visualize the relationship between two continuous variables while 
allowing the identification of trends, clusters, and outliers. The interactivity enhances usability, offering exploration of data subsets 
and revealing patterns that might not be apparent in the full dataset.
    Key insights from this analysis reveal a clear clustering around neutral sentiment and minimal price changes, reflecting the market's 
stability on most days. However, extreme positive or negative price changes are associated with a wider spread in sentiment scores, 
indicating that significant market movements often correlate with polarized news headlines. Company-level analysis highlights distinct 
sentiment and stock price patterns; for example, Netflix shows more pronounced shifts in later years compared to more established companies 
like Apple and Microsoft. Year-specific analysis sheds light on trends during critical events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, which 
drove extreme sentiment and stock price movements across all companies.
    Overall, this analysis underscores the impact of financial news on stock performance, providing an in-depth view of market dynamics. The 
interactivity of the graphs, combined with the detailed breakdown of sentiment scores, makes this visualization an effective tool for 
understanding investor behavior and predicting market responses to news events. 

Annual Trends in Search Query Categories and Their Similarity to Market Terms 
    This bar chart visualizes the annual trends of top Google search query categories and their similarity scores compared to market-related 
terms between 2006 and 2013. The marks in this visualization are vertical bars, with the x-axis representing different search categories 
such as "It's the Economy," "Stocks," and "Google News Searches," and the y-axis displaying similarity scores, which range from 0 (no 
similarity) to 1 (full similarity). The color of the bars represents the year, enabling the viewer to track temporal changes in search 
trends. The height of the bars indicates the strength of alignment between the search query categories and market-related terms, with 
taller bars reflecting higher similarity.
    A bar chart was chosen for this data because it effectively compares categorical data across multiple years, highlighting shifts in search 
trends over time. The color-coding of years enhances the chart’s readability, while the straightforward alignment of categories and 
similarity scores allows for a focused evaluation of how societal priorities relate to financial markets.
    Key insights from this chart include notable spikes in similarity scores for categories such as "It's the Economy," "Economy," and "Stocks" 
during pivotal years like 2008, 2011, and 2012. These spikes correspond to major economic events, including the global financial crisis, 
the U.S. debt ceiling crisis, and the Eurozone debt crisis, underscoring heightened public interest in financial markets during times of 
instability. On the other hand, categories like "Google News Searches" and "Technology" display moderate alignment, reflecting Google's 
important role in disseminating financial and technological information.
    This chart effectively communicates the evolving relationship between public interest and economic conditions, demonstrating how search
trends reflect societal priorities during periods of economic uncertainty. By leveraging the simplicity of a bar chart to showcase 
categorical and temporal comparisons, this visualization provides valuable insights into how public welfare and financial market concerns 
intersect over time.

Trading Volumes vs. GDP Growth Rate Correlation
    This heatmap explores correlations between trading volumes of the MAANG companies and GDP growth rate for the United States. The marks 
in the visualization are square tiles which represent the organizational correlation between two variables. The channel here is color, 
which represents strength and direction of the correlation. Red indicates positive correlation and blue indicates negative, with both 
getting darker as the correlations get closer to 1 and -1 respectively. The position of each tile aligns with the variables on the x and 
y-axis. Numeric labels offer additional clarity about precise correlation values.
    We chose to represent this data using a correlation heatmap because it effectively communicates the relationships between multiple variables. 
This visualization is efficient and compact for conveying correlation information, which suits our goals for analysis well. By further 
adding labels for exact correlation values, this heatmap becomes an interpretable visualization to show relationships and patterns in our 
data.
    Key insights show a strong positive correlation between Apple and Google volumes (0.90) and Microsoft and Google volumes (0.74), indicating 
synchronized trading activity among these companies and showcasing shared market trends. Conversely, Netflix trading volume shows negative 
correlations with Apple (-0.58), Amazon (-0.63), and Microsoft (-0.40), suggesting that Netflix's trading activity may respond to differing 
market forces compared to other tech firms. The GDP growth rate exhibits negative correlations with Apple (-0.49), Microsoft (-0.33), and 
Netflix volumes (-0.66), meaning that the higher economic growth may be associated with reduced trading activity in these companies and 
possibly reflecting shifts in investor focus from active trading during stable economic periods. Meanwhile, Google volume shows a slight 
positive correlation (0.29) with GDP growth, contrasting with the others.
    Overall, this heatmap effectively visualizes the degrees of correlation across trading volumes and GDP growth, offering insights into market 
dynamics and company-specific trends.

Stock Price Highs and Lows vs. GDP Growth Rate Correlation
    This graph is the complementary visualization to the previous heatmap. It has been divided into two subplots to allow for greater clarity 
of variables and easier, targeted analysis. This heatmap examines the correlations between the high and low stock prices of major tech 
companies and GDP growth rate. Here, the marks and channels are the same as the previous heatmap as both visualizations follow the same 
structure, but differ due to the inclusion of two MAANG stock variables compared to the previous singular variable. 
    To reiterate, a heatmap is ideal for this data because it effectively visualizes the relationships among multiple variables while 
highlighting patterns and differences. By leveraging color intensity and numeric values, it enables viewers to quickly identify significant 
correlations and compare trends across companies and metrics. Especially with more variables being compared in this heatmap, we needed to 
ensure our data would be represented as clearly as possible without unnecessary confusion added.
    Key insights start with strong positive correlations being evident between Apple and Amazon stock prices, both in highs (0.94) and 
lows (0.95), reflecting their similar market trends. Google’s high and low prices also correlate strongly with Amazon (0.78 and 0.76, 
respectively) and Apple (0.75 and 0.76), highlighting consistent relationships across these companies. Netflix’s high prices show weaker 
correlations and a slight negative correlation with Microsoft low prices (-0.11), suggesting non-correlative price movement dynamics. 
GDP growth rate shows moderate positive correlations with Google’s stock highs (0.55) and Microsoft highs (0.54), suggesting some alignment 
between economic growth and stock performance.
    This heatmap effectively captures the connection of stock price movements among the tech companies while highlighting unique patterns, 
such as Netflix’s divergence. It provides a clear and comprehensive overview of how these variables relate to each other and the broader 
economic context they operate in.

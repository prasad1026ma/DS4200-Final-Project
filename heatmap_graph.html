        <h3>Google Stock Data and GDP Growth Rate Correlation</h3>
        <img src="Heatmap_Volume.png" alt="Stock Volume Heatmap" style="width:100%; max-width:800px; height:auto; display:block; margin:auto;">
        <p> This heatmap illustrates the correlations between the trading volumes of major tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google) and GDP growth rate.
            There is a strong positive correlation between Apple and Google volumes (0.90) and Microsoft and Google volumes (0.74), indicating synchronized trading activity 
            among these companies, showcasing shared market trends. Conversely, Netflix trading volume shows negative correlations with Apple (-0.58), Amazon (-0.63), and Microsoft (-0.40), 
            suggesting that Netflix's trading activity may respond to differeing market forces compared to other tech firms. 
            The GDP growth rate exhibits negative correlations with Apple (-0.49), Microsoft (-0.33), and Netflix volumes (-0.66), demonstrating that the higher economic growth may be associated 
            with reduced trading activity in these companies, possibly reflecting a shift in investor focus from active trading to holding positions during stable economic periods. Meanwhile, 
            Google volume shows a slight positive correlation (0.29) with GDP growth, contrasting with the others.

        <img src="Heatmap_price.png" alt="Stock Price Heatmap"  style="width:100%; max-width:800px; height:auto; display:block; margin:auto;">
        <p>This heatmap demonstrates the correlations between the high and low stock prices of five major tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google)
             and GDP growth rate. Strong positive correlations are evident between Apple and Amazon stock prices, both in highs (0.94) and lows (0.95), reflecting their 
             similar market trends. Google’s high and low prices also correlate strongly with Amazon (0.78 and 0.76, respectively) and Apple (0.75 and 0.76), highlighting 
             consistent relationships across these companies. Netflix’s high prices show weaker correlations and a slight negative correlation with Microsoft low prices (-0.11), 
             suggesting non-correlative price movement dynamics. GDP growth rate shows moderate positive correlations with Google’s stock highs (0.55) and Microsoft highs (0.54), 
             suggesting some alignment between economic growth and stock performance.
